# Ren'py Image Creation Tool
Streamline your Ren'py VN development.<br>
RITC is a tool intended to shorten the time spent writing (or copy-pasting) image blocks in Ren'py, and everything else that comes with it.<br>
<strong>Currently compatible with Ren'py 8.0.x and likely later versions of Ren'py 7.x (Not exactly sure when it stopped being required to add the full file path). Adding support for the older syntax soon.

# <strong>Current features</strong><br>
<strong>Scene preview:</strong> Fine-tune your image before output.<br>
<strong>Alternative timings</strong>: Create multiple, alternatively timed scenes at once based on the same frames.<br>
<strong>ConditionalSwitch</strong>: Easily create ConditionalSwitches off your new images.<br>
